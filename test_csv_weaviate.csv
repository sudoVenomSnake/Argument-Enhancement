The petitioner is an insurance company involved in a case of third-party liability under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\. The tribunal ruled that the insurance company must deposit the awarded compensation amount and later recover it from the owner of the vehicle. The petitioner appealed this decision, arguing that such directions were beyond the tribunal's jurisdiction and were based on Article 142 of the Constitution.

","
1. Whether the tribunal had the authority to direct the insurance company to deposit the compensation amount and recover it from the vehicle owner.
2. Whether the directions given by the tribunal were based on Article 142 of the Constitution of India.

","
  
The court examined the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the relevant judgments, including National Insurance Co.Ltd. v. Swaran Singh and others, to determine whether the tribunal had the authority to issue the directions. The court found that the directions were in line with the Act and were not based on Article 142 of the Constitution, as argued by the petitioner. They cited precedents that clarified the liability of insurance companies in third-party cases and upheld the tribunal's power to issue such directions for deposit and recovery.

","
  
The court rejected the petitioner's appeal and upheld the tribunal's decision. They ruled that the directions given to the insurance company to deposit the awarded compensation amount and recover it from the vehicle owner were valid and in line with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\. The court clarified that such directions were not based on Article 142 of the Constitution of India and were within the tribunal's jurisdiction. The insurance company was directed to comply with the tribunal's order, and the appeal was dismissed with no order as to costs.
","
  
The petitioner, the insurance company, contended that the directions issued by the tribunal were not within its jurisdiction. They argued that the directions were based on Article 142 of the Constitution of India, which does not grant the tribunal the power to issue such orders. The petitioner sought to challenge the tribunal's decision on these grounds.

","
  
The respondent, the claimant or the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident, defended the tribunal's decision. They asserted that the tribunal had the authority to issue the directions based on the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\. The respondent supported the tribunal's ruling, stating that it was in line with the established principles and interpretations of the law.

1. Michael Johnson was peacefully protesting outside a government building.
2. Officer Smith arrested Mr. Johnson during the protest.
3. The petitioner alleges that excessive force was used during the arrest, resulting in injuries.

","
1. Whether the arrest of Mr. Johnson was lawful?
2. Whether the respondent, Officer Smith, used excessive force during the arrest?

","
  
The court needs to determine whether Officer Smith's actions were justified given the situation and whether they violated Mr. Johnson's constitutional rights. The central aspect of this case would be to weigh the petitioner's First Amendment right to peaceful protest against the respondent's interest in maintaining security and order.

The court will likely consider the following factors:

1. The level of threat posed by Mr. Johnson at the time of arrest.
2. The actions and behavior of both Mr. Johnson and Officer Smith leading up to and during the arrest.
3. Whether the use of force was proportionate to the circumstances.

","
  
The court's decision will have significant implications for law enforcement procedures during public demonstrations. If the court rules in favor of Mr. Johnson and finds the arrest unjustified or the force excessive, it may set a precedent for cases involving similar claims of civil rights violations.
","
  
The petitioner argues that his arrest was unlawful and that Officer Smith used excessive and unnecessary force. He claims that he was peacefully protesting, exercising his First Amendment rights, and not engaging in any violent or disruptive behavior when the arrest took place. Additionally, Mr. Johnson asserts that the injuries he sustained during the arrest were a direct result of the respondent's use of excessive force.

","
  
The respondent, Metropolitan Police Department, may present the following arguments:

1. Officer Smith acted lawfully, believing that there was a potential threat to the government building's security.
2. The respondent may argue that the use of force was necessary to restrain Mr. Johnson, given the circumstances of the protest.

1. The Jammu & Kashmir Service Selection Board advertised vacancies for Motor Vehicle Inspector (Survey) and Motor Vehicle Inspector (Tech.) on 29.12.2005\.
2. The initial eligibility qualification required a diploma in Auto Mobile Engineering with 5 years of experience in a recognized institution of the State Transport Undertaking.
3. Subsequently, a corrigendum was issued modifying the eligibility criteria to include specific diplomas and work experience in automobile workshops, along with a minimum general educational qualification of passing X standard.

","
1. Whether the corrigendum issued by the Selection Board modifying the eligibility criteria is legally valid?
2. Whether the revised eligibility qualification prescribed by the corrigendum is consistent with the relevant recruitment rules?

","
  
The court observed that the State Government and the Central Government both have the power to prescribe qualifications for the post of Motor Vehicle Inspector. The Central Government, under Section 213(4) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, issued a notification (SO 443(E) dated 12.6.1989) prescribing minimum qualifications for the post. The State Government also prescribed qualifications through the Jammu & Kashmir Transport Controller's (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules, 1974\. The court clarified that both qualifications have to be considered side by side. The qualification prescribed by the Central Government should be taken as the minimum qualification, and the qualification prescribed by the State Government is considered an additional qualification to the extent that it is not covered in the Central Government's prescribed qualification.

","
  
The court held that the corrigendum issued by the Selection Board, modifying the eligibility criteria for the posts of Motor Vehicle Inspector, is legally valid. The eligibility qualification prescribed by the Central Government (SO 443(E) dated 12.6.1989) serves as the minimum qualification, and the qualification prescribed by the State Government in the recruitment rules is considered additional to the extent it is not included in the Central Government's prescribed qualification. The court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the Selection Board to proceed with the selection process based on the revised eligibility criteria.
","
  
The petitioners contended that the posts of Motor Vehicle Inspector are governed by the Jammu & Kashmir Transport Controller's (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules, 1974\. They argued that the qualification prescribed in the original notification is in line with the said rules, making the corrigendum, which introduced new eligibility criteria, invalid.

","
  
The respondents argued that the Central and State Governments both have powers to prescribe the minimum qualifications for the post of Motor Vehicle Inspector. They claimed that the corrigendum was issued in accordance with the powers vested in the Central Government under Section 213(4) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the new qualification aligns with the Central Government's prescribed minimum qualifications.

Ray Constructions Ltd. hired an excavator from its sister concern for a project at Karipur, Kozhikode. While returning the excavator, the vehicle was intercepted, and entry tax was demanded.

The petitioner's sister concern argued that the excavator was not a motor vehicle as it was mounted on chains and not fitted with wheels, making it unsuitable for road use.

The Intelligence Inspector issued a notice proposing a penalty for tax evasion.

The petitioner filed a writ petition challenging the proceedings under the Entry Tax Act, and the Sales Tax Officer adjudicated the matter, holding against the petitioner.

","
1. Whether the excavator in question qualified as a motor vehicle under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\.
2. Whether the excavator was liable for entry tax under the Kerala Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas Act, 1994\.

","
  
The Court noted that the definition of ""motor vehicle"" under Section 2(28) of the Motor Vehicles Act includes any mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use on roads, with ""adapted for use"" meaning ""suitable for use."" The Court referred to previous judgments and held that the term ""motor vehicle"" should be understood based on the features of the specific vehicle in question.

The Court distinguished this case from previous decisions that considered excavators as motor vehicles because the present excavator was mounted on chains, not fitted with wheels, and had a speed of only 1.5 km/hr. This made it unsuitable for road use, and it could cause damage if moved on roads.

The Court also considered a communication from the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, which indicated that excavators running on chains were not considered motor vehicles under the Entry Tax Act.

","
  
The Court ruled in favor of the petitioner, stating that the excavator in question was not a motor vehicle as per the definition under the Motor Vehicles Act. Hence, it was not liable for entry tax under the Kerala Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas Act. The Court quashed the previous orders and allowed the petitioner's claim.
","
  
The petitioner contended that the excavator was not a motor vehicle as defined under the Motor Vehicles Act because it was mounted on chains, not fitted with wheels, and was unsuitable for road use.

","
  
The respondent authorities argued that the excavator should be considered a motor vehicle for the purpose of entry tax liability.

The petitioner applied for a permanent permit on 20.08.2009 but submitted a lease agreement and an application dated 21.02.2012 before the arguments were heard.

The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) granted the permanent permit based on the lease agreement.

The objector filed an appeal before the STAT, arguing that the petitioner did not fulfill the criteria for permit grant as he did not own the vehicle at the time of application.

The STAT allowed the appeal, and the High Court upheld its decision, holding that the petitioner did not own the vehicle at the time of application.

","
1. Whether the petitioner met the criteria for permit grant at the time of application.
2. Whether the lease agreement submitted before the hearing should be considered in determining ownership for permit grant.

","
  
The Court considered the judgment in Padam Chand Gupta case and the statutory provisions, including Section 2(30) of the Motor Vehicles Act, which creates a legal fiction of ownership in favor of the lessee for the limited purpose of the Motor Vehicles Act. The Court held that the petitioner, having submitted the lease agreement before the hearing, could be deemed the owner for the purpose of the Motor Vehicles Act.

The Court also discussed judgments from other courts, supporting the view that the qualification criteria should be considered at the time of passing the order.

","
  
The Court allowed the review petition, recalling its previous order, and set aside the STAT's decision. It held that the petitioner, having submitted the lease agreement before the hearing, fulfilled the criteria for permit grant, and thus, he was deemed the owner of the vehicle for the purpose of the Motor Vehicles Act.
","
  
The petitioner argued that he had submitted the lease agreement before the hearing, and as per the judgment of the Division Bench in Padam Chand Gupta and another Vs. State Transport Authority, the applicant must fulfill the criteria at the time of passing the order, not necessarily at the time of application.

","
  
The respondent contended that the petitioner did not own the vehicle at the time of application, and hence, he did not meet the criteria for permit grant.

The petitioner, a young girl aged 6 years at the time of the accident, was involved in a road accident that caused her to become paraplegic. She suffered complete loss of sensation below chest level and could not walk or stand. Despite her disability, she continued her education and excelled academically, but her physical condition severely impacted her everyday life.

","
  
The primary issues before the court were:

1. The quantum of compensation to be awarded to the petitioner for the permanent disability and its impact on her life.
2. Determination of compensation for loss of earning capacity, loss of amenities of life, loss of matrimonial prospects, disfigurement, future treatment, cost of wheelchairs, future attendant charges, conveyance and future conveyance, cost of special garments, and physiotherapy.
3. The rate of interest to be applied on the compensation amount.

","
  
The court relied on various precedents and principles established in similar cases to arrive at a fair and just compensation amount. The court considered the petitioner's permanent disability, loss of earning capacity, loss of amenities of life, disfigurement, and the impact of the accident on her education and future prospects. It also took into account the cost of future treatment, special equipment, and attendant charges required for her care and mobility.

","
  
The court allowed the appeal filed by the petitioner and enhanced the compensation from the original award. It awarded a total compensation of ₹41,19,928, considering the various heads of damages claimed by the petitioner. The court also ordered the respondent to deposit the enhanced amount with the specified bank. The court's decision aimed to provide the petitioner with just and adequate compensation to help her cope with the challenges and expenses caused by her disability throughout her life.
","
  
The petitioner argued that due to the accident's severity, she suffered significant physical and mental trauma, and her future prospects were adversely affected. She sought just and adequate compensation for her pain and suffering, loss of earning capacity, and the cost of medical treatment and attendant charges required for her life-long condition.

","
  
The respondent, likely an insurance company or the party responsible for the accident, may have contested the compensation amount, arguing that it was excessive or that certain heads of damages claimed by the petitioner were not justified.

The petitioner's maternal uncle, A.K. Palanisamy, owned a Toyota Innova car. On 3rd January 2011, he executed a sale-cum-delivery receipt in favor of the petitioner, transferring ownership. The petitioner cleared the dues with the bank, and the registration certificate was transferred to his name on 28th January 2011\. However, after A.K. Palanisamy's death on 12th January 2011, a complaint was made, alleging that the transfer was based on forged documents. The second respondent canceled the registration, and the first respondent upheld the decision on appeal.

","
  
The key issues in the case were:

1. Whether the transfer of ownership occurred before or after the death of the previous owner, A.K. Palanisamy?
2. Whether the cancellation of the registration was valid based on the application of Section 50(1) or Section 50(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988?

","
  
The court analyzed Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and concluded that ownership transfer precedes the endorsement of transfer in the registration certificate. The court emphasized that Section 50(1) applies when the transfer of ownership has occurred, and the transferor and transferee must report the transfer to the registering authority within specific periods. On the other hand, Section 50(2) applies when there is no transfer of ownership at the time of the owner's death, and the person succeeding to the possession of the vehicle must apply for transfer of ownership.

The court relied on a decision of the Bombay High Court, which interpreted a similar provision under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, to support its conclusion that transfer of ownership takes effect from the date of sale and not from the date of recording the transfer in the registration certificate.

","
  
The court allowed the writ petition, setting aside the orders of the respondents. It held that the transfer of ownership in this case occurred on 3rd January 2011, and the cancellation of registration based on Section 50(2) was not valid. The court restored the endorsement of transfer of ownership made on 28th January 2011 in favor of the petitioner.
","
  
The petitioner contended that the transfer of ownership was completed on 3rd January 2011, before A.K. Palanisamy's death, and hence, Section 50(1) of the MV Act applied. The petitioner argued that the cancellation of the registration based on Section 50(2) was erroneous, and Rule 56 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, relied upon by the respondents, did not apply in this case.

","
  
The respondent contended that the petitioner suppressed A.K. Palanisamy's death and fraudulently sought ownership transfer, leading to the cancellation of registration. They relied on Section 50(2) of the MV Act and Rule 56 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, to support their decision.

On 19-8-1984, the deceased, Mohamed Rasul, was riding his motorcycle towards Panruti when another motorcycle driven by Thandavamurti, the third respondent, came in a rash and negligent manner. Thandavamurti took a sudden right turn without giving any signal, resulting in a collision between the two motorcycles. The deceased sustained a serious head injury and died, while Thandavamurti also suffered injuries.

The appellants, who were the legal representatives of the deceased, filed a claim for compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/-. Thandavamurti also filed a claim for compensation of Rs. 80,000/- for the injuries he sustained in the accident.

","
1. Whether the claimants are entitled to ""no fault liability"" under Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for the accident that occurred on 19-8-1984, before the provision came into force.
2. Whether the Tribunal's finding that the deceased was negligent and not entitled to any compensation is correct.

","
  
The court first considered the issue of the applicability of ""no fault liability"" under Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\. It noted that the accident occurred on 19-8-1984, while Section 140 came into force on 1-7-1989\. The court observed that the provision for ""no fault liability"" was introduced with the aim of providing compensation without proof of fault or negligence on the part of the vehicle owner or driver.

The court referred to previous judgments that held Section 92-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (which introduced ""no fault liability"" with compensation of Rs. 15,000/-) to be prospective and not retrospective. It further cited the principle that when the substantive law is altered during the pendency of an action, the rights of the parties are decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new statute clearly intends to vary such rights.

The court held that Section 140, which replaced Section 92-A and enhanced the compensation amount, should also be considered as substantive in nature. It reasoned that giving retrospective effect to Section 140 would impose a new obligation on the vehicle owner or insurer, which could prejudice their existing rights. Therefore, the court held that Section 140 should not be applied retrospectively to the accident that occurred on 19-8-1984\.

","
  
The court allowed the appeal and awarded the claimants Rs. 65,000/- as 50% of the total compensation. The court also held that the claimants were not entitled to ""no fault liability"" under Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as the provision should not be applied retrospectively to the accident that occurred on 19-8-1984\.
","
  
The counsel for the appellants argued that Thandavamurti's sudden right turn without giving any signal caused the accident. He contended that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidence of the pillion rider, PW4, who witnessed the accident and supported the claimants' version of events.

The counsel also argued that the claimants should be entitled to the enhanced compensation of Rs. 50,000/- under Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as per the amendment introduced on 14-11-1994, even though the accident occurred before the provision came into force.

No one appeared on behalf of the respondents.
