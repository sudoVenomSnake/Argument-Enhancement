They contended that even though the victim was hit by the unknown truck after getting off their truck, the connection between the accident and the use of their truck was established. They relied on previous Supreme Court decisions and emphasized that Section 163A is a social welfare legislation and should be construed in favor of accident victims.\n",
      "Ratio and Reasoning: The court referred to previous Supreme Court decisions and emphasized that Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, provides for no-fault liability, and the expression used is \"accident arising out of the use of the motor vehicle.\" The court noted that the expression \"arising out of the use of the vehicle\" should be given a liberal and wide interpretation in favor of accident victims.The court relied on previous decisions that held that the word \"use\" in the context of motor vehicles should be construed in a wider sense, including the period when the vehicle is stationary and parked on the road. It was held that the appellants' truck was still in use when it stopped near the level crossing and was hit by the unknown truck.The court further reasoned that the accident had a connection with the use of the appellants' truck, as the victim had to get off the truck due to the collision, and it was necessary for the driver to inspect the damage before restarting the truck.\n",
      "Arguments of Respondents: The respondents contested the claim and denied their liability to pay compensation. They argued that the victim's death was not caused by an accident arising out of the use of their truck but was due to the impact of the unknown truck. They claimed that their truck was not directly involved in the accident, and thus, the appellants were not entitled to compensation under Section 163A.\n",
